Jupyter Notebooks are a super versitile tool that can be used to analyze and communicate data and insights. Jupyter notebook uses Python which is one of the most popular and versitile programming languages out there. For this lecture, we are going to focus on the basics of using Python for data science, as well as two tools that you'll use every day as a data scientist and quantitative Trader: Pandas and Numpy"

Statisticians take a very pessimistic view, and require a certain statistical significance of deviation from the norm within the sample in order to reject the null hypothesis. This statistical significance is called alpha, $\\alpha$. This $\\alpha$ differs from quantitative finance alpha, as statistical alpha represents the significance level of a hypothesis test, while the quantitative finance alpha measures excess portfolio returns. It's unfortunate that they use the same variable since they are both so important to quantitative traders, but it is what it is.\n",

If you want to learn more about Python for Data Science, towardsdatascience.com is a great resource that you can leverage to learn more independently."
